Packets:
-> In networking, packets are fundamental units of data that are transmitted over a network. They contain both control information and the actual data (payload) being sent.

DNS:
->DNS (Domain Name System):

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.
DNS serves as the phonebook of the internet, converting human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This process allows users to access websites and other online services using easy-to-remember domain names rather than complex IP addresses.
